SuperCollider syntax grammars for Atom.io

SuperCollider is a programming language for real-time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition.

The language interpreter runs in a cross-platform IDE (OS X/Linux/Windows) and communicates via Open Sound Control with one or more synthesis servers. The SuperCollider synthesis server runs in a separate process or even on a separate machine so it is ideal for real-time networked music.
